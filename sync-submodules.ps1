# Sync every submodule to its tracked remote branch tip, then record the bump.
#
# Why this exists: a git submodule pins ONE commit SHA in the parent repo -- that
# is what makes a checkout reproducible, and there is no "track latest" mode in
# git. So when a submodule's upstream moves (e.g. you push nui_wc2 from another
# machine), this repo keeps pointing at the old commit until someone explicitly
# advances it. This script is that explicit action, in one step.
#
# Why fast-forward onto the branch, NOT `git submodule update --remote`: that
# command checks each submodule out at a DETACHED HEAD, which leaves it with no
# branch and no upstream to compare against. VS Code then has nothing to report,
# so you are never told you're on stale code -- and the local branch silently
# rots. Keeping each submodule ON its tracked branch is precisely what makes
# drift visible: VS Code opens detected submodules as their own repositories and
# autofetches them, so the moment a branch tip passes the recorded SHA the
# parent reports the submodule as modified.
#
# Divergence fails loud instead of being papered over: nothing here edits a
# submodule, so local commits or a wrong branch means a human needs to look.
#
# NOTE: keep this file pure ASCII. PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less .ps1 as
# Windows-1252; non-ASCII inside a STRING literal becomes mangled bytes and the
# script dies silently with exit code 0.
#
# Usage:  .\sync-submodules.ps1
